# blog-manager by Jon
This is a program which I use to automatically format my blog posts, create the files, update the index.html page, and more.
I also used Bash scripting to automate other parts of development e.g. building is automated (release.sh and build.sh), committing the web files to the github repo is automated (update.sh) etc.

## Plans for future improvement
- Better code formatting and adding more comments.
- Make post writing easier aka add more formatting so I don't need to write the HTML for the main content each time I want to post.
- Create a nicer index.html page.
